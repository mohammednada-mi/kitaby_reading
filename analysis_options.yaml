# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, plugins, and libraries. Recommended lints are continuously updated
# to reflect Flutter best practices.

linter:
  # The lint rules are categorized pursuant to the Dart style guide
  # (https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
  #
  # These rules enforce recommended practices, potentially avoiding errors
  # and improving the readability of your code.
  #
  # For a full list of supported rules, see
  # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/options/options.html

  # Uncomment to disable specific rules. Alternatively, you can disable rules
  # in-line comments by using // ignore: name_of_lint, or
  # // ignore_for_file: name_of_lint. Disable as few rules as possible.
  rules:
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
    # prefer_const_constructors: true # Enforce const constructors where possible
    # prefer_final_fields: true # Prefer final for instance fields initialized only in constructor
    # unnecessary_new: true # Avoid 'new' keyword
    # unnecessary_const: true # Avoid 'const' keyword when not needed
